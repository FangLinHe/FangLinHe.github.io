# My Personal Page on GitHub Pages

## What?

The source code of my personal page on [github.io](https://fanglinhe.github.io).

## When?

Since December, 2020, during the boring Christmas holiday.

## Why?

I would like to learn Swfit better and want to take some notes. Suddenly I came
up the idea to build a simple blog to record what I have learned. It might be
helpful for myself or some other people at some point in the future.

## How?

Thanks to [this tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), I could
build this GitHub Page easily.

## Who?

Well, me.

## Where?

In Switzerland. But the location doesn't matter, as we are all on the "WWW".
