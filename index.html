    Hi, I'm Fang-Lin. The main purpose of this website is to gather my <a href="/notes">notes</a> when I learn something new.
    They would be quite messy or even simply copy-paste some resources. But it is a good way of making sure what I have read something,
    and it might be helpful for myself at some point, although I don't think it would happen very often.
    I am currently learning Swift, so you can find many of the <a href="/notes">notes</a> are related to learning Swift.
  </p>
  <p>
    I may also post something not related to the notes in <a href="/blogs">blogs</a>. Currently I don't plan to write any technical
    articles, so most of them might be just bla bla bla.
  </p>
  <p>
    Maybe in the near future I would move more contents of <a href="https://fanglinhe.wixsite.com/fanglinhe" target="_blank">
    my out-dated website</a> to this website, but at least I have moved my favorite boring maze game into my <a href="/works">
    previous works</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can find some information about me in <a href="/about">about</a>, but I don't plan to update it. If you are curious, simply
    visit my LinkedIn profile.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, this simple website is the result of following steps described in
    <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>. Thank you soooooo much!
  </p>
