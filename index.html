    <h1>My Notes</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Fang-Lin. The main purpose of this website is to gather my notes when I learn something new. I am currently learning Swift, so you can find many of the <a href="/notes">notes</a> are related to learning Swift.</p>
    <p>Maybe in the near future I would move the contents of <a href="https://fanglinhe.wixsite.com/fanglinhe" target="_blank"> my out-dated website</a> to here.</p>
    <p>This simple website is the result of following steps described in <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>. Thank you soooooo much!</p>
