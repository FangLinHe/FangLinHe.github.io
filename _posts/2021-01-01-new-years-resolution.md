The year 2020 has finally passed! I believe it was a tough year for lots of people 😞. I really missed the time of traveling to other countries and experiencing different cultures easily, visiting friends freely, and meeting people without mouth masks. Although I haven't seen the light at the end of the tunnel yet, I hope the situation of covid-19 will improve soon.

# Achievement / Events in 2020

* **🏐 Rank 3 in the regional volleyball league 19/20 season** - March 2020

  <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/2021-01-01-new-years-resolution-2.jpg" style="width: 50%; max-width: 400px" title="STV St. Gallen Damen 3"/></div>

  It was my second year to play in the league with STV St. Gallen. The final ranking was the third position, which is one position better than the previous year. I really enjoyed a lot playing with my teammates!

* **👩‍💻 Switched job successfully** - June 2020

  It was my second time trying to find a job in Switzerland. With the previous work experiences and already holding a work permit, it was much much easier comparing to when I just graduated 5 years ago.

  I still appreciate a lot my former employer and ex-colleagues who made my dream of working in Switzerland come true, especially the friend who shared the job information on WeChat. It was totally a coincidence to get that job offer, as I was in Taiwan and not actively looking for new challenges.

  Seeking for the new job was mainly to change the environment, as I wanted to apply Machine Learning in a "different format" of products and to learn something new. It was a perfect opportunity to work for my current employer, as I got the opportunity to learn iOS app development apart from developing Machine Learning algorithms and models as my main responsibility.

* **🐈 Adapted two cats** - October 2020

  I love cats since long time ago after watching so many cute pictures and videos, especially after having a cat visiting my apartment very often. I called the cat 胖胖 (Pan-pan), which means fatty, as he is quite heavy. At some point, he even waited for me at the parking area and followed me home immediately when I got home. But when the weather got nicer, he preferred staying outside and almost never visited me for a long time.

  On the day when I onboarded, I was so surprised to see a cute, little black cat sleeping at the shared office! Unfortunately s/he didn't appear any more whenever I was at the office. One day, my colleague said, "Hey, we should get Fang-Lin a cat!", as I was always searching for that black cat. After considering everything and checking with my landlord about the apartment regulations, I decided to try to search for cats to adapt.

  I was quite lucky that after sending few requests, I got the non-negative reply: "Your apartment might be too small for two cats, but please contact the foster home". Luckily, they had cats they had just rescued from France, that they even hadn't posted the information online yet. After a month, two little and active cats finally arrived! They were really frightened on the first three days, but fortunately they adapted very well afterwards. 

* **🇩🇪 Finished B1+ German course** - December 2020

  <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/2021-01-01-new-years-resolution-5.jpg" style="width: 50%; max-width: 400px" title="Notes of preparing the presentation in B1+ course"/></div>

  I stopped learning German for almost one year after the "in-office" B1 course during my previous job. The reason is quite simple: it's too difficult! I felt really frustrated after that part of the course, and decided to stop learning it a bit to study and review what I have learned. And of course, it didn't work without taking any courses due to the laziness.

  I decided to continue taking German courses on Saturdays starting from February, 2020. It was really a tough decision, as it means to "sacrifice" almost all the weekends and probably some weekday-nights to learn German. It was even very embarrassing in the first course, as the teacher tried to chat with me to know more about me, but I couldn't even remember what "Nachbarn" (neighbors) means. However, I still stayed in the German course, as I knew the importance of German.

  The course was unfortunately interrupted for almost two months due to covid-19, and course happened online quite often afterwards. Fortunately, our teacher still overcame all the difficulties and enough classmates still attended the course, so we still finshed B1 (2/2) and B1+ courses eventually. Other than that, a lot of grammar that I didn't understand a year ago is much clear after these courses, I can read more news articles without looking up in the dictionary, and I can communicate in German slightly better, although I have no opportunity to speak it at all outside the classroom.
